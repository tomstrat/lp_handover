        <h2>Compendium</h2>
        <article>
          <p>I have previously written a "handbook" or guide to anything Local Pages Websites. It can be found in this
            location: <a
              href="https://localpages.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/EQHoZi6aen9Hpf6jnX4LC2IBtRoEiw4hNJwY6EXr9s4L1g?e=ur7jKx"
              target="_blank">Compendium</a>.
          </p>
          <p>This should be used when dealing with anything related to our website offerings. Some of this information
            will be duplicated in this document, and where this is the case, is where i deem it vital or more important.

        <h2>Hosting</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>GoDaddy</h3>
          <p>Go Daddy is Local Pages original hosting environment. It currently holds the most sites to date. The reason
            Go Daddy was chosen as a hosting platform originally was to accommodate UPUGO, a 3rd party we used at the
            time. While we still host many of our websites on this platform, new websites use our other two platform
            choices. Migration plans are in discussion and Go Daddy may become redundant at some point in the future.
          </p>
          <p>Go Daddy is easy to use and tends to hold the user's hand when using the platform. The downside to Go Daddy
            is every product is packaged and generally more expensive than other alternatives.</p>
          <p>Go Daddy offer managed Wordpress hosting, SSLs included and some small level of hosting support. You can
            purchase more web support if required. Go Daddy also offers a Wordpress maintenance dashboard allowing mass
            updating of plugins and other support features. </p>
          <h3>Siteground</h3>
          <p>Siteground is now Local Pages preferred choice of hosting platform when creating websites in-house.</p>
          <p>Siteground prides itself on superior managed Wordpress hosting. Local Pages made the move to Siteground
            primarily as a test for Fit My Floor, and after use we preferred its simplicity, support and price.</p>
          <p>Siteground while less user friendly than Go Daddy, is still simple to use, comes with a very handy live
            chat
            and lots of freedom to manage the hosting environment.</p>
          <p>Siteground offers managed Wordpress hosting, free SSLs, web support and file manager, plus lots of other
            developer features. It also boasts very quick speeds for bigger sites.</p>

        <h2>Wordpress</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Recommended Plugins</h3>
          <p>Wordpress is home to a huge amount of plugins, many of which are poorly designed or solve very specific
            problems, some of which can even be harmful to a Wordpress site.</p>
          <p>I have listed below some plugins we use on the large majority of sites and ones I would turn to before
            others:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contact Form 7 (contact form)</li>
            <li>Yoast SEO (SEO)</li>
            <li>Really Simple SSL</li>
            <li>Better Search Replace</li>
            <li>Headers and Footers (for accessing head of documents)</li>
            <li>Elementor (builder)</li>
            <li>Woo Commerce (shop)</li>
            <li>Code Snippets (custom PHP)</li>
            <li>ACF (Custom Fields)</li>
            <li>Hustle (popups)</li>
            <li>Smush (image compression)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>FMF</h3>
          <p>One of the more complex sites we house with Wordpress and host on Siteground is Fit My Floor.</p>
          <p>While I won’t go into detail on how to develop for the site or maintain what is there (they are replacing
            soon) I will explain its basic infrastructure and any quirks to be aware of.</p>
          <p>FMF is hosted on Siteground, the sole reason is to do with space requirements and the ability to access
            more than just the public_html folder. I would recommend you leave this site on here until they replace it,
            as you may run into issues putting it onto Godaddy.</p>
          <p>FMF’s origin was developed with UPUGO. This means that there are some skeletons in the closet that can
            appear from time to time. The main one being the strange configuration they set for the shop when FMF wasn’t
            selling online. Once UPUGO we’re gone we have worked hard to convert their work into the online shop it is
            today. What this means, is that there are sections of the site that are NOT online shop, and these are here
            for legacy purposes.</p>
          <p>The “Online Shop” section has its own products that are categorised by “real product” on the back end.
            Without this checked, the product will not be available for purchase, or appear on the “Online Shop
            section”. </p>
          <p>Many of the real products also have a lot of customisation with new fields depending on category and custom
            styling for the single item pages. I recommend this not be touched or changed, as the code written for it is
            complicated and can tank the site if messed with.</p>

      <h1>Database</h1>
      <div class="innerArticle">
        <h2>Directory Generator</h2>
        <article>
          <p>This is the tool used to download XML from the current database. Its in a hidden URL location:
            “database.ad.localpages.co.uk/index.php?target=directorygenerator”.</p>
          <p>Its simple to use, simply pick a book to download and choose XML. </p>
          <p>DO NOT choose XML + AUI as this setting is in testing and doesn’t do as intended.</p>
          <p>There is a guide on SharePoint on how to add this data to the InDesign document found here: <a

        <h2>Check All Free Entries</h2>
        <article>
          <p>While the current database is still in use you will need to ensure all free entries are “checked” or
            compilated. The page to do this is in Books -> Select Book -> All Free Entries.</p>
          <p>There are check boxes next to all the free entries that need to be ticked then submitted (at the top) for
            them to be added to the XML download. Many of the books have thousands of these and the task of ticking them
            all can take a long time. A solution to this would be to use the code below in the console to mass tick them
            all. </p>
          <p>Right click the webpage and select inspect. Navigate to the console tab and paste this code in and submit:

        <h2>TC Reports</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Regarding any spreadsheet I have worked on in the past, chances are you will find its location in TC
            Reports which is on sharepoint here: <a

          <p>Feel free to move, edit and use to your wishes. You may find spreadsheets I have worked on that you need,
            or formulae that I wrote in which you can steal and use on other spreadsheets.</p>
          <p>The below topics covered are all based inside of TC reports.</p>

        <h2>Phone Data</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>BT</h3>
          <p>The BT phone data can be found in TC Reports under Sales Call Monitor. BT Phone data is found on their <a
              href="https://btcloudvoice.bt.com/businessportal/login.jsp" target="_blank">portal</a>. Login credentials
            can be found with Ollie.</p>
          <p>The data retrieved is only based on the landlines of Local Pages, for Sales purposes this is now virtually
            mute as sales primarily use their mobile phones. That being said this data can still be used to find numbers
            who called Local Pages or who employees called from the landlines.</p>
          <p>This portal can also be used to update the settings of the phones in the office. There are MANY settings
            all of which can be confusing (I don’t fully understand them all). Despite this the support team for BT
            Cloud Voice are very helpful and always give me the needed information. <a

          <h3>Vodafone</h3>
          <p>The Vodafone data can be found in TC Reports under Sales Call Monitor. Vodafone data is found on their <a

              target="_blank">portal</a>. Login credentials can be found with Ollie.</p>
          <p>The data retrieved is based on the mobile phones of Local Pages. This is the primary data for Sales. It
            should be noted that the data can only be taken in 3-6 month intervals and starting and ending in the middle
            of the month. This is due to the billing period. </p>
          <p>It should also be noted that their portal is very temperamental and often breaks or is offline. Also many
            of the buttons don’t do as intended or don’t work at all.</p>

          <p>Allocation data and spreadsheets can be found in TC Reports under Allocation.</p>
          <p>There are lots of files here, mainly things that are for the current round of allocation. Previous data and

          <p>The most notable folder for someone taking over is the Tools folder. This folder contains all the necessary

      <h1>LP Tools</h1>
      <div class="innerArticle">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <article>
          <p>This section covers the various tools i have developed over the years for LP and it will be up to LP to
            decide whether they continue to be used.</p>
          <p>Many of these tools are command line applications, meaning they dont have a friendly front end environment
            for someone to use. Where this is the case i will point out that it isnt for everyones use and also give
            small instructions on how to use this for a technical employee who feels comfortable using it.</p>
          <p>All of these tools are found on my <a href="https://github.com/tomstrat" target="_blank">Github</a>. They
            are publicly available for LP to clone and continue to use as you see fit. They will remane hosted and live
            for the long term future as it costs me nothing and some of these tools you still rely on to this day (LP
            Sig).</p>
        </article>

      <div class="innerArticle">
        <h2>LP Signature</h2>
        <article>
          <p>LP Signature is a tool desinged to allow easy access for employees to change their signature when marketing
            deem it necessary. This tool has a front end and can be found here: <a
              href="https://tomstrat.github.com/LPSig" target="_blank">LPSig</a>.</p>
          <p>While this has a front end, in order to change the content of the signature, the back end must be adjusted.
            The back end consists of HTML CSS and JS. The HTML is written in a very specific way in order to accomodate
            for email signatures (tables).</p>
          <p>I have handed over both the tool and instructions on how to edit the file to Paul Marshall. He is
            comfortable with the system and will continue to update and use this tool for the forseeable future. He will
            need to handover to whoever takes over in the future.</p>
          <p>I reccomend these files are not changed unless they are parts i have told Paul to change, or someone who is
            changing them knows what they are doing. As stated above, this code can be found on my github and can be
            recloned if required again.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The Asana Scraper is a very specific tool designed to backup all LPs Asana tasks and data to a spreadsheet
            for storage.</p>
          <p>The scraper is a command line tool and is written for the specific task of backing up LP data. Because of
            the lack of front end, this tool should only be used by a technical employee who understand Node.js.</p>
          <p>While the tool is available here: <a href="https://github.com/tomstrat/asanaBackup" target="_blank">Asana
              Backup</a> the API keys required to make this work have been removed for security reasons. The technical
            employee will need to create new keys and replace them.</p>

        <h2>Dentons Scraper</h2>
        <article>
          <p>The Dentons Scraper is a tool designed to scrape the Dentons.net website for listings.</p>
          <p>This tool does see use when Sales want some extra data to parse especially if a new area is added to the
            books.</p>
          <p>This tool is a command line application with no front end. Its also quite a specific scraper for the
            current version of the Dentons.net site. This should only be used by a technical employee who knows Python /
            Node.js</p>
          <p>The current Dentons.net site has an empty robots.txt (the file stating scrapers allowance. <strong>THIS
              COULD CHANGE</strong> and if thats the case then i reccomend you do not scrape unless confident its still
            ok to do so.</p>
          <p>The scraper can be found here <a href="https://github.com/denton-scrape" target="_blank">Scraper</a></p>

        <h2>LP Tickets</h2>
        <article>
          <p>LP Tickets is a ticketing app specifically designed for Local Pages. It has user accounts and allows any
            customer given a login to send tickets to support.</p>
          <p>It didn't see much use when first developed so could do with someone taking over its use and handing out
            logins for customers to use.</p>
          <p>Its currently still hosted on Heroku (for free) and will remain this way for the forseeable future. If you
            wish to move the hosting or update the application it will require a technical employee to clone the
            repository and move the hosting elsewhere.</p>
          <p>It will need a major Admin user in order to make new accounts and check tickets, this can be discussed
            before i leave and i will make the needed changes.</p>
          <p>The live app can be found here: <a href="https://lpticketz.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Live App</a>.

        <h2>Import Artwork</h2>
        <article>
          <p>The Import Artwork tool is a JSX InDesign script designed specifically for pulling in artwork to a document
            (LBB).</p>
          <p>It works by having you choose a folder for it to parse, then it scours the document for the artwork tag,
            and takes its contents (the name) and finds the corrosponding .eps in the chosen folder.</p>
          <p>The method highlighted above, is very specific and would require recoding to change the way it works. This
            is why its important the process stay the same for this to continue to be used.</p>
          <p>This can also be found on my github if needed, but the script is the InDesign applications already and can
            be taken or backed up there.</p>
          <p>The script can be found here <a href="https://github.com/tomstrat/importArtwork" target="_blank">Import
              Artwork</a></p>
          <p>This script saves HOURS of time for the builder of the book and is quite critical for the process to remain
            smooth. If any facet or aspect of the process changes or the script requires changing or improving, a
            technical employee will need to have a strong knowledge of Javascript and the Adobe Application API.</p>
